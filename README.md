The historical game of Tab
# Tab (Tâb), الطاب (Al-Taab)
The game of Tab, sometimes spelled Tâb, and in Arabic – الطاب, is a Middle Eastern game, that has both, luck and strategy, components. Many Tab boards have been found carved into stones, in Jordan (Petra), however, their dating is problematic, and we do not know if they have been carved by the Bedouin in the last few hundred years, or if they date to antiquity. 

This is the first computerized version of the historical game, which is currently played in some parts of the Arab world, particularly, Jordan, Egypt, and Sudan. The Historical value of this game was published in the Journal of near eastern studies, title:

The genetic algorithm is used as the core of the heuristic for this game, the results were published in the International Journal of Gaming and Computer-Mediated Simulations (IJGCMS), the paper is entitled "On Computerizing the Ancient Game of Ṭāb" cite as "Hassanat, A.

# GAME COMPONENTS AND RULES
The game has three main components: a board, pieces and four stick dice. First, the game of ṭāb uses a game board that consists of a fixed number of rows (4) but a varying number of holes per row, referred to here as columns. The first row is home to the soldiers of the first team, and the fourth row to the opposing team. The in-between rows represent the battlefield. The soldiers move in a specified direction along the board. Figure 3 depicts the game board and the move directions.

Second, the game features playing pieces commonly referred to soldiers or puppies by local players. They are represented by white and black circles in Figure. 3. Players commonly use stones of two distinct colours, preferably black and white. The number of soldiers for each team is identical to the number of columns on the board.
The red-dotted arrows shown in Figure 3 depict the moves of the white soldiers, while the black arrows show the moves of the black soldiers. Each player starts with one soldier on their left-hand side —D1 for white, and A12 for black. Soldiers cannot return to their home row, however, they can enter the opponent’s home row. When they do so, they remain frozen until all the soldiers in the other rows have been captured. Some players prefer to protect some of their soldiers from capture this way, since the opponent’s soldiers cannot reach this row once they are in play.
Third, four stick dice are used to get a value with which a player can move their soldiers. These sticks are rectangular in shape and identical in size. They are commonly taken from Oleander trees, then cut horizontally to get a half cylinder shape with one flat side, represented here with a white colour, and one convex side, shown here as a dark green or brown colour. An overview of the values and the probabilities of each throw is presented in Table 1.

Stick dice are used instead of cubic dice. The latter are common in previously programmed games such as backgammon , Yahtzee and Monopoly. All six numbers on a cubic die have an equal probability. When using stick dice, players get five different numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, or 6), but each number has a different probability as shown in Table 1.
When a player throws the sticks, the number of flat or white sides determine the moves the player may play. If just one of the four sticks shows its flat side, the player may move one piece one square further along the board. This score of one is called ṭāb. Ṭāb is considered the best move in the game; first, it is not allowed to jump over opponent’s soldiers, so that this move allows for capturing soldiers directly in front of one’s own piece; second, it allows the player to play again, i.e., the player throws the sticks again after completing this first move of one square; finally, it is the only throw that allows a soldier to move from its home row. The game and the throw are named after each other.
If any two sticks show their flat sides, the player gets to move two squares. If three sticks show their flat sides, the player gets to move three and four when four sticks show their flat sides. The player gets six when no flat side is shown. There is no value of “five” that can be thrown with these sticks.
The probabilities of getting 1, 4 and 6 are relatively small and if thrown the player is allowed to throw the sticks again just as with the throw of ṭāb. In contrast, the player stops playing and gives the sticks to the opponent after throwing 2 or 3.
At the beginning of the game, each player throws the sticks once; the one who gets the largest number starts playing the game. Each player needs to throw a ṭāb to free their first soldier; if not, the other player takes their turn to play. After a soldier is freed by one ṭāb move, it can be moved with all other throws as well. Players may agree to relax this rule in order to speed up the game. The players move their soldiers from the home row in a specific order, from the rightmost piece to the leftmost piece. 
As indicated above, one turn may consist of multiple throws of the sticks. A player may choose to play a soldier directly or the player can wait until all the throws in one turn are completed. In the latter case, the player is allowed to move one or more of the pieces using their throws in any sequence they wish.
If a player’s piece lands on any hole occupied by an opponent’s piece, the opponent’s piece is captured and removed from the game. A player may move one or more of their own soldiers onto the same square, creating a set. The set then moves as a whole and is potentially captured as a whole. To disassemble a set, a ṭāb throw is needed to remove one piece to the next position. A set is not allowed to move around in the back row of the opponent. Once it reaches this row or is created there, it stays put. Only if no other moves are possible can a set on an opponent’s home row be moved. 
After a soldier reaches the right end of the home row, it proceeds up one hole and begins moving clockwise in the two center rows. Here the soldier will circle in the center two rows until it is captured or moved into the opponent’s home row. In other words, the game of ṭāb has a race and a war game component, which is known as a running-fight game. The options for moving pieces that a dice throw affords suggest that the game should be considered a competitive strategic game rather than a gambling game. In addition, the player is allowed to wait until all the throws have finished, after which the optimal order of moves is determined. This adds further strategy to the game.
